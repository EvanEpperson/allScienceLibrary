# allScienceLibrary

A basic library about Science fiction books only. The basic layout is a simple crud functionality that lets you create new books at the top right and then lets you see the books in the middle of the screen . I found a website that alowed us to get all of the books and the description of all of the books https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/science%20fiction/_/N-2C?Ntk=Category_Title . And then I found a basic css layout with javascript that alowed us to flip to the back of the book and open the book to read the inside of the pages and see the description on the back from this website https://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/01/08/3d-book-showcase/ . We had to tweak alot of the functionality of the flip book because it wouldnt work out of the box so we took alot of it out and made it able to work with react. We put the edit functionality inside of the book instead of making it so that you could read inside of the book and then kept the description on the back. We also had to use a "bootstrap" type site that was https://cdnjs.com/libraries/modernizr and it helped us with the javascript functionality of the flipping of the book .
